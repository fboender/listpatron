Things which would be cool to implement:
- SQL import / Export (This will probably be included in v0.4)
- Direct SQL connection (reading/writing data to DB instead
  of XML)
- Group-editing of lists over networks (needs locking, etc)
- Web frontend
- Ncurses frontend
- Plugins
- Additional Column based view instead of row based (as with MS Access):
    
    row-based: 
       
       titel      | author   | rating
       ------------------------------
       Beermoney  | Onkey, D | 5
       The Ghost  | Foo, B   | 3

    column-based:

       title  : [ Beermoney ]
       author : [ Onkey, D  ]
       rating : [ 5         ]

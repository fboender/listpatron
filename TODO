Small things that need to be taken care of but which I'm going to forget about
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Lots of non-freed data.
* Listpatron DTD v0.1 doesn't take in account Case (In)Sensitive matching in filters/sorts/etc.
* Deprecated GTK items used:
	- GtkItemFactory
	- gtk_signal_connect
* Structures used for inter-function communication should be named ui_struct_
* (listpatron:13099): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtktreemodel.c: line 998 (gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first): assertion `GTK_IS_TREE_MODEL (tree_model)' failed
  Reproduction:
    - Start listpatron.
	- Save the list.
	- Error occurs.

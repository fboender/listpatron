Small things that need to be taken care of but which I'm going to forget about
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Lots of non-freed data.
* Listpatron DTD v0.1 doesn't take in account Case (In)Sensitive matching in filters/sorts/etc.
* Deprecated GTK items used:
	- GtkItemFactory
	- gtk_signal_connect
* Structures used for inter-function communication should be named ui_struct_
* gchar should be used where appropriate.
* Bug: New sorting rule with name 'Unnamed' overwrites existing 'Unnamed' rules without prompting.
* rename 'listpatron.dtd' to 'listpatron-0.1.dtd'
* Adding the first new row results in :
  (listpatron:5489): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: file gobject.c: line 1642 (g_object_get_data): assertion `G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed
  Non-critical bug; As far as I know doesn't cause any real problems
* Saving a list without rows results in:
  (listpatron:16668): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtktreemodel.c: line 1001 (gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first): assertion `GTK_IS_TREE_MODEL (tree_model)' failed
  Non-critical bug; As far as I know doesn't cause any real problems
* $(prefix) (gnu autotools). Fix.
	23:48 < muntyan> todsah: it's allright
	23:48 < muntyan> it seems
	23:49 < muntyan> yes, i reconfigured without distclean, and it used cached locations
	23:49 < todsah> ah okay.
	23:49 < muntyan> todsah: it's because you didn't put DATADIR to config.h

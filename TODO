Small things that need to be taken care of but which I'm going to forget about
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Lots of non-freed data.
* Listpatron DTD v0.1 doesn't take in account Case (In)Sensitive matching in filters/sorts/etc.
* Deprecated GTK items used:
	- GtkItemFactory
	- gtk_signal_connect
* Structures used for inter-function communication should be named ui_struct_
* gchar should be used where appropriate.
* Bug: New sorting rule with name 'Unnamed' overwrites existing 'Unnamed' rules without prompting.
* Move 'data/' to 'xml/'
* rename 'listpatron.dtd' to 'listpatron-0.1.dtd'

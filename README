1. About ListPatron

	ListPatron is a GTK2 application which aids in the keeping of lists of
	information like books, movies, todo's, addresses, etc. Lists are freely 
	definable by the user and can be searched, sorted, exported and (in the 
	future) filtered. Reports can be created from information in various 
	formats.
